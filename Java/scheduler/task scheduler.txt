the idea:
I want to schedule a specific task to happen at a specific time
the time can be far into the future, so I wouldn't like it to be saved on memory - saving on disk is preferrable
I want to load a reasonable amount of tasks to run each time into the memory and keep other tasks on disk

I look at the timeline, and at each moment there may be a task scheduled
occasionally I look forward at upcoming tasks in the timeline and I decide which tasks should I load into memory


what do I want to implement at the basic level?
- option to schedule a task: given a time and a task, we schedule the task to happen at the given time
	a task is a duo of:
	1. a code which should be run
	2. parameters to run that code with
